## 📚 Patterns Implemented

| No. | Pattern                 | Description |
|-----|--------------------------|-------------|
| 01  | **Singleton**            | Ensures only one instance exists |
| 02  | **Factory Method**       | Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic |
| 03  | **Builder**              | Builds complex objects step-by-step |
| 04  | **Adapter**              | Makes incompatible interfaces work together |
| 05  | **Decorator**            | Adds responsibilities dynamically |
| 06  | **Proxy**                | Adds a representative with control access |
| 07  | **Observer**             | Notifies dependent objects on state change |
| 08  | **Strategy**             | Switchable behaviors at runtime |
| 09  | **Command**              | Encapsulates actions as objects |
| 10  | **MVC**                  | Separates data, view, and control |
| 11  | **Dependency Injection** | Injects dependencies for loose coupling |
